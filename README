= Redmine Bitbucket GIT Hook

This plugin allows you to automatically insert a local git repository if you

This plugin is a fork from Redmine BitBucket Hook from Alessio Caiazza ( https://bitbucket.org/nolith/redmine-bitbucket )

== Installation

1. Installing the plugin
* Follow the plugin installation procedure at http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Plugins.
* Restart your Redmine.
* Create in your redmine folder a folder named bitbucket_git_repositories ( if you want to use an other name, set it up under plugin configuration AND create it! )

2. Create Git Repository unter BitBucket
* See under BitBucket if you don't know yet

3. Insert Git Repository to Redmine
* Edit your project and insert into the path-field the SSH Path to your BitBucket repository ( eg git@bitbucket.org/UserName/GitRepo.git )
* The Plugin will remove your external path and instead insert a logal path - that's all so far.
* Additional Hint: If your Repository is private, the bash user running the script needs to use a registered ssh key on bitbucket.org. Private Repositorys are only usable via SSH, not via HTTPS.

4. Automatically Update Repository
* Go to the repository Admin interface on Bitbucket and click the 'Service' link on 'Additional options/settings' menu.
* Under "Services Administration" add a new "POST" service.
* Compile the URL field with: "[redmine_installation_url]/bitbucketgit_hook" (for example "http://example.com/bitbucketgit_hook").
* That's it. Bitbucket will now send a HTTP POST to the Redmine Bitbucket Hook plugin whenever changes are pushed to Bitbucket. The plugin then takes care of pulling the changes to the local repository and updating the Redmine database with them.
